[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arjanfrans/brecourt.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/arjanfrans/brecourt)

A simple 2D game wirrten in C++, with future plans to become an easy to use 2D game engine.

## F.A.Q.

### Where does the project name come from?

*"In mathematics, a plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface. A plane is the two-dimensional analogue of a point (zero dimensions), a line (one dimension) and three-dimensional space. Planes can arise as subspaces of some higher-dimensional space, as with the walls of a room, or they may enjoy an independent existence in their own right, as in the setting of Euclidean geometry."* - source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry))
